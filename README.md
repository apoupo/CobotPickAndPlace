# CobotPickAndPlace

# Current Implementation: 
Trace all alphabets in Matlab using Elephant Robotics' mycobot 280.
This repository makes use of Matlab's example to trace end effector trajectory using simulink: https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ug/trace-end-effector-ik-simulink.html

Steps to run:

1) Download the mycobot_ros2 repository from github. https://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros2
2) Navigate to “mycobot_ros2/mycobot_description/urdf/280jn” and paste all files in the repo to this directory.
3) Modify "alphabet" to display in line 22 of runalphabetTraj.m
4) Run runAlphabetTraj.m

#Future Implementation:
